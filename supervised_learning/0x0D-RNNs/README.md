A recurrent neural network is a neural network that is specialized for processing a sequence of data x(t)= x(1), . . . , x(τ) with the time step index t ranging from 1 to τ. For tasks that involve sequential inputs, such as speech and language, it is often better to use RNNs. In a NLP problem, if you want to predict the next word in a sentence it is important to know the words before it. RNNs are called recurrent because they perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being depended on the previous computations. Another way to think about RNNs is that they have a “memory” which captures information about what has been calculated so far.
